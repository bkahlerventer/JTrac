JTrac is a generic issue-tracking web-application that can be easily customized by
adding custom fields and drop-downs. Features include customizable workflow,
field level permissions, e-mail integration, file attachments and a detailed history view.

<p/>


JTrac was created after the author felt that he could write a much better alternative to
a commercial defect tracking tool that he was having to use.  Development started in 2004.
There have been quite a few releases already and a small but growing base of satisfied users
exist who are friends and colleagues of the author.  JTrac is ideal for issue tracking but
is so generic that you can use it to track well - almost anything.

<p/>

JTrac development used to be hosted at <a href="https://jtrac.dev.java.net">https://jtrac.dev.java.net</a>
but moved to SourceForge in 2006.  If you are interested in
the older working version (based on Spring JDBC and MS Access) you can download it
<a href="https://jtrac.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=3992&expandFolder=3992&folderID=0">here</a>.
Note that it is not being maintained any more and the database schema will change significantly in the new JTrac.

<p/>

Now JTrac is under active re-development on JDK 1.5, JSP 2.0, Hibernate 3.1, and Spring 2.0
(including Spring Webflow 1.0 and the Acegi security framework for Spring 1.0). Everything is being
refactored aggressively to use the very best and latest in Java.

<p/>

Another big change is the move to Maven 2 so the web site and documentation should be
auto generated soon. We are currently laying a foundation of best practice with JUnit tests,
Checkstyle, EMMA (for code coverage) and Selenium as well (for automated functional tests).
The skeleton for this is mostly ready, so soon the code will begin to fall into place.
Most of the functionality is available and will be just copied over from the old code base.
And, this time there is a stronger focus on future-proofing the design as far as possible.
